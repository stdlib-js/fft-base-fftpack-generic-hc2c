    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/fft-base-fftpack-generic-hc2c
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

## Usage

```javascript
var hc2c = require( '@stdlib/fft-base-fftpack-generic-hc2c' );
```

#### hc2c( N, hc, strideHc, offsetHc, out, strideOut, offsetOut )

Converts a real-valued array in [FFTPACK][fftpack] half-complex format to a complex-valued array.

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );
var Complex128Array = require( '@stdlib/array-complex128' );
var floor = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-floor' );
var rffti = require( '@stdlib/fft-base-fftpack-generic-rffti' );
var rfftf = require( '@stdlib/fft-base-fftpack-generic-rfftf' );

var N = 4;
var w = new Float64Array( ( 2*N ) + 34 );

rffti( N, w, 1, 0 );

var r = new Float64Array( [ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] );

rfftf( N, r, 1, 0, w, 1, 0 );
// r => <Float64Array>[ 10.0, -2.0, 2.0, -2.0 ]

var out = new Complex128Array( floor( N/2 ) + 1 );

hc2c( N, r, 1, 0, out, 1, 0 );
// out => <Complex128Array>[ 10.0, 0.0, -2.0, 2.0, -2.0, 0.0 ]
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **N**: length of the original real sequence.
-   **hc**: input array in [FFTPACK][fftpack] half-complex format.
-   **strideHc**: stride length for `hc`.
-   **offsetHc**: starting index for `hc`.
-   **out**: output complex array.
-   **strideOut**: stride length for `out`.
-   **offsetOut**: starting index for `out`.

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   [FFTPACK][fftpack]'s [`rfftf`][@stdlib/fft/base/fftpack/generic/rfftf] stores the forward DFT of a length `N` real sequence in `N` real values using the following layout:

    ```text
    Even N: [ DC, Re(1), Im(1), Re(2), Im(2), ..., Re(N/2-1), Im(N/2-1), Nyquist ]
    Odd N:  [ DC, Re(1), Im(1), Re(2), Im(2), ..., Re((N-1)/2), Im((N-1)/2) ]
    ```

    where `DC` is the zero-frequency component and `Nyquist` is the component at frequency `N/2` (even `N` only). Both are always purely real.

-   The output is a complex-valued array of length `floor(N/2) + 1`. The `DC` and `Nyquist` components are stored with an explicit zero imaginary part.

-   This half-complex format differs from other conventions (e.g., [FFTW][fftw-halfcomplex]). In FFTW's half-complex format, all real components are stored first, followed by imaginary components in reverse order.
